# EcoTelemetry

OpenTelemetry-backed observability for [Eco](https://play.eco) game servers. Exports exceptions, runtime metrics, simulation perf, and traces over OTLP so server admins can point them at Sentry, Grafana, Datadog, Honeycomb, or any other OTLP-compatible backend.

Eco's built-in stats system is designed for in-game economic and ecological reporting. It does not surface SRE-shaped signals: process health, exception rates, simulation tick latency, or web-request latency. EcoTelemetry fills that gap.

## Status

Early. v1 ships:

- **Logs:** exception capture (`AppDomain.UnhandledException`, optional `FirstChanceException`) and an Eco `ILogWriter` decorator that mirrors the server's own log lines through OTel.
- **Metrics:** runtime instrumentation (GC, threadpool, allocations) plus `eco.players.online`. Each signal can route to its own OTLP endpoint via per-signal overrides.

Traces are stubbed.

## Install

1. Download `EcoTelemetry-<version>.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/coilysiren/eco-telemetry/releases).
2. Extract into your Eco server's `Mods/` directory so the result looks like `Mods/EcoTelemetry/EcoTelemetry.dll`.
3. Copy `Configs/EcoTelemetry.example.json` to `Configs/EcoTelemetry.json` and edit:
   - `OtlpEndpoint`: your collector's OTLP HTTP or gRPC endpoint
   - `OtlpHeaders`: any auth headers (e.g. `x-honeycomb-team=...` or Sentry's auth header)
   - `ServiceName`, `ResourceAttributes`: how this server identifies itself
   - per-signal toggles: `EnableLogs`, `EnableMetrics`, `EnableTraces`
4. Restart the Eco server.

If `OtlpEndpoint` is empty, EcoTelemetry falls back to the console exporter so you can verify the pipeline locally before pointing it at a real backend.

## Build

```bash
dotnet build EcoTelemetry.csproj -c Release
```

The build pulls `Eco.ReferenceAssemblies` from NuGet for type-checking. The DLL plus its OpenTelemetry dependencies must be deployed together — see `.github/workflows/release.yml` for how the release artifact is assembled.

## Routing signals

Each signal (logs, metrics) can target its own OTLP endpoint via the `OtlpLogsEndpoint` / `OtlpMetricsEndpoint` overrides; anything left blank falls back to the top-level `OtlpEndpoint`. Empty everywhere means console exporter (handy for first-boot smoke test).

### Sentry (logs)

Sentry's OTLP endpoint is documented at <https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/install/cdn/#using-opentelemetry>:

- `OtlpLogsEndpoint`: `https://o<org>.ingest.sentry.io/api/<project>/otlp/v1/logs`
- `OtlpLogsHeaders`: `x-sentry-auth=Sentry sentry_key=<dsn-public-key>`

### VictoriaMetrics (metrics)

vmsingle exposes a native OTLP ingest endpoint at `/opentelemetry/api/v1/push` on its HTTP API port (8428 by default). No auth header required.

- `OtlpMetricsEndpoint`: `http://<vmsingle-host>:8428/opentelemetry/api/v1/push`
- `OtlpMetricsProtocol`: `HttpProtobuf`

Any OTLP-capable backend (Honeycomb, Grafana Cloud, OTel Collector) works the same way - there is no backend-specific code path.
